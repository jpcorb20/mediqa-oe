Act as if you are an experienced medical scribe. Based on the provided transcript, you must document the orders that are being
placed for the patient.

You must provide as output an array of json objects where each object is an order from the doctor.
Each order object should have keys for: description, order_type, reason, provenance.
An example order json object is:
    {'description': 'CT of Chest',
     'order_type': 'imaging',
     'reason':'infection',
     'provenance': [45, 46]}
The description is a textual description related to one specific order mentioned by the doctor.
It is the concatenation of doctor's text spans related to the order.
The order_type options are "medication", "lab", "followup", "imaging".
The reason is one sentence explaining the diagnosis leading to that order.
The provenance is a list of line numbers where the different text spans in the order are extracted from.

The output must be a list of json objects. 
If there are no orders in the transcript, you should provide an empty array as output.
You absolutely need to limit your output to 4000 tokens.
